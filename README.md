Proof of concept for a marketing simulator GPT wrapper which can help you hone in on your target audience, or tailer your message to reach them. It is horrendously slow, so plenty to optimize, i.e. not looping over GPT calls but doing a single one for multiple prompts, but working code is better than optimized broken code.

Maybe a bit outdated but put it in a micro-servicy sort of code structure over two container. Now this is pointless but there might be a future in which it makes sense to have part on it on some heavy storage (cloud) compute and the somewhere else. I know docker was not part of the challenge but it's just a little bonus.

I did not use the output to do any serious analysis as it is all for fun but I added some suggestions on how to use the output. Some added functionality can make it very useful for covering as many people as possible with a single marketing text or allow you to find a set of marketing messages that cover multiple people and can be very targeted based on the persona characteristics.

Also the code is sparsely commented but I think it should be readable. If there are any questions please reach out.
